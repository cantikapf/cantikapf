### Hello! Welcome to my profile ‚ú®

I'm Cantika, an International Relations bachelor graduate but I have a special interest in Tech üëã 

I'm currently working on making [International Relations study guide website](https://github.com/cantikapf/international-relations-study-guide). The idea comes from my personal experience. When I went to college, I had no idea how I should start studying because I was too overwhelmed with the course and ended up wasting time to build my study routine. So, I think this study guide will help people to how to start their study in International Relations.

Currently, I'm also writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@cantikapf). Please check it out if you're interested ‚ô•Ô∏è

If you want to reach me, you can send me an email [here](https://cantikaportfolio.site/contact.html)
