### Hello! Welcome to my profile ✨

I'm Cantika, International Relations bachelor graduate but I'm have special interest in Tech 👋 (btw, pronouns is She/Her) 

I'm currently working on making [International Relations study guide website](https://github.com/cantikapf/international-relations-study-guide). The idea is come from my personal experience. When I going to college, I really had no idea how I should start studying because I'm to overwhelmed with the course and ended up wasting time to build my study routine. So, I think this study guide will help people to how to start their study in International Relations.

Currently, I'm also writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@cantikapf). Please check it out if you're interested ♥️
