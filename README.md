### Hello! Welcome to my profile âœ¨

I'm Cantika, International Relations bachelor graduate but I'm have special interest in Tech ðŸ‘‹ (my pronouns is She/Her) 

I'm currently working on making International Relations study guide website. The idea is come from my personal experience. When I going to college, I really had no idea how I should start studying because I'm to overwhelmed with the course and ended up wasting time to build my study routine. So, I think this study guide will help people to how to start their study in International Relations.

Currently, also writing blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@cantikapf).
